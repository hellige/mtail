This is a file tailer with color support, written in Python. it has a
[modest home page](http://matt.immute.net/src/mtail).

Please see usage (`mtail -?`) for details. The config file format is
described in [`mtailrc.sample`](mtailrc.sample), which you should copy to
`~/.mtailrc` (on Windows, call the file `.mtailrc` and place it in a directory
referred to by `%HOME%`). Some additional info may be gotten from comments in
[the script itself](mtail).

`mtail` should work with any version of Python 3. Of course, please let me know
if you find bugs, fix bugs, or make any other improvements, and there's a good
chance they'll end up in a future release (with acknowledgements, of course).

`mtail` is derived in small part from `colortail-0.3.0` by Joakim Andersson
(pt98jan@student.hk-r.se).
