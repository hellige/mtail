mtail-0.9.0

by matt hellige (matt@immute.net)

this is a file tailer with color support, written in python. it has a
modest home page at 'http://matt.immute.net/src/mtail'. this README will
be expanded in future versions. there is guaranteed to be at least one 
more version: i will do a 1.0 release when i'm satisfied that it is 
bug free. it seems fairly good to me now, but i'd like to bang on it 
a little more. there are a few other features i'd like to add, but i'm
not planning on going overboard: i believe in small tools for small jobs.

i've used it with a few patchlevels/builds of python 1.5. i'm not sure if 
it'll work with 1.6 or 2.0, but i'd like to find out, so please let me know 
if you try it. also, of course, please let me know if you find bugs, fix
bugs, or make any other improvements, and there's a good chance they'll
end up in a future release (with acknowledgements, of course).

please see the usage ("mtail -?") for details. the config file format is
described in mtailrc.sample, which you should copy to ~/.mtailrc (on 
windows, call the file .mtailrc and place it in a directory referred to by
%HOME%). some additional info may be gotten from comments in the script
itself. 

mtail is derived in small part from colortail-0.3.0 by joakim andersson 
(pt98jan@student.hk-r.se). it is an improvement on that work in several
areas:
  - it is roughly 500 lines of code, rather than roughly 3500.
  - it does not dump core when it encounters long lines.
  - the regexp matching process is simpler and, in my opinion, more intuitive,
    as is the config file format.
  - there is only one config file, which contains coloring rules for an 
    arbitrary number of files.
  - my coloring algorithm only generates escape codes when the color actually
    needs changing, rather than around every single character.
  - by virtue of being written in python, it is less platform-dependent.
  - i support pre-coloring filters.


share and enjoy!
